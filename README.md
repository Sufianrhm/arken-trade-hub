## Vision

Financial interfaces are often cluttered, slow, and cognitively overwhelming.  
Arken focuses on performance-first design, modular architecture, and clean user interaction to create a responsive, professional trading environment.

The long-term goal is to evolve Arken into a scalable trading ecosystem with advanced analytics, execution tooling, and seamless data integration.

- **React 18**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Radix UI**
- **TanStack React Query**
- **Lightweight Charts**

This architecture enables fast builds, type safety, composable UI systems, and efficient state management.

- `components/` – Reusable UI components
- `pages/` – Route-level views
- `hooks/` – Custom React hooks
